    "\n",
    "If friends living in different parts of the worlds plan to spend a vacation together within a limited budget, it is extremely difficult to chose a common destination as flight prices may be very high from one origin and cheaper from another. Therefore, we want to create an optimized platform which will suggest a common destination at the cheapest price from multiple airports at the cheapest price. It will also take into account the preferred arrival and departure times of each individual.\n"
